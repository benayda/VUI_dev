        "Take expiration dates with a grain of salt as they are not federally regulated. A use by or best by date typically indicates when the product will be at its best quality. There may be a change in taste, texture, or color after the use by or best by date, but that is only a problem if the food smells off."

        "use by dates",
        "Use by dates are not federally regulated and typically indicate when the product will be at its best quality. While there may be a change in taste, texture, or color after the use by date, as long as the product smells okay, it should be fine to eat."

        "Sell by dates typically indicate when products will be at the peak of their quality. After the sell by date, there may be a change in taste, texture, or color, but unless the food smells bad, it will be fine to eat it."

        "best by dates",
        "The best by date indicates when the quality of the product is expected to be at its height. However, the food product will generally be quite good after the best by date even if there is some change in taste, texture or color. Just make sure the food smells fine before you eat it."

        "Toss a mishmash of items into a tortilla, fried rice, or pasta salad. To use up wilted lettuce, you can saute it with butter and garlic. Even if you waste a little less, that is still an accomplishment."

        "reduce food waste",
        "The best way to reduce food waste is to plan your meals and shop based on your plan. Another way to reduce food waste is to buy local produce in season, which naturally has a longer shelf life as well as being more nutritious and tastier. Ignoring sell-by dates will also help you reduce food waste, but make sure that you smell food first. If the food smells off, throw it out, preferably in the compost bin. Also, if you go to a buffet, only put what you are going to eat on your plate."

        "food is safe to eat",
        "A big misunderstanding is that when food is old, it will make you sick. The main reason for illness is pathogens like salmonella and E. coli that contaminate food at the farm or processing plant. If food does not smell good, throw it out, preferably in the compost bin."

        "food is spoiled",
        "Check for mold on food products. Also, potatoes that are green inside should not be eaten. Throw out meat, oil or nuts that smell rancid."
