# Voice User Interface (VUI) Development

This repo includes code for Voice User Interface (VUI) applications I have developed. My first set of VUI apps are Alexa skills, which have been published and are available on Amazon:

1) My Work-from-Home Coach

This Alexa skill uses voice to address problems users raise and provide them with strategies so they can work from home successfully.

2) Waste Less Food

This Alexa skill uses voice to offer strategies for users to reduce the amount of food they are wasting.
